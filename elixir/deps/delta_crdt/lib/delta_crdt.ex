  Start and interact with the Delta CRDTs provided by this library.

  A CRDT is a conflict-free replicated data-type. That is to say, it is a distributed data structure that automatically resolves conflicts in a way that is consistent across all replicas of the data. In other words, your distributed data is guaranteed to eventually converge globally.

  Normal CRDTs (otherwise called "state CRDTs") require transmission of the entire CRDT state with every change. This clearly doesn't scale, but there has been exciting research in the last few years into "Delta CRDTs", CRDTs that only transmit their deltas. This has enabled a whole new scale of applications for CRDTs, and it's also what this library is based on.

  A Delta CRDT is made of two parts. First, the data structure itself, and second, an anti-entropy algorithm, which is responsible for ensuring convergence. `DeltaCrdt` implements Algorithm 2 from ["Delta State Replicated Data Types – Almeida et al. 2016"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01529.pdf) which is an anti-entropy algorithm for δ-CRDTs. `DeltaCrdt` also implements join decomposition to ensure that deltas aren't transmitted unnecessarily in the cluster.

  While it is certainly interesting to have a look at this paper and spend time grokking it, in theory I've done the hard work so that you don't have to, and this library is the result.

  With this library, you can build distributed applications that share some state. [`Horde.Supervisor`](https://hexdocs.pm/horde/Horde.Supervisor.html) and [`Horde.Registry`](https://hexdocs.pm/horde/Horde.Registry.html) are both built atop `DeltaCrdt`, but there are certainly many more possibilities.

  Here's a simple example for illustration:

  ```
  iex> {:ok, crdt1} = DeltaCrdt.start_link(DeltaCrdt.AWLWWMap, sync_interval: 3)
  iex> {:ok, crdt2} = DeltaCrdt.start_link(DeltaCrdt.AWLWWMap, sync_interval: 3)
  iex> DeltaCrdt.add_neighbours(crdt1, [crdt2])
  iex> DeltaCrdt.read(crdt1)
  %{}
  iex> DeltaCrdt.mutate(crdt1, :add, ["CRDT", "is magic!"])
  iex> Process.sleep(10) # need to wait for propagation for the doctest
  iex> DeltaCrdt.read(crdt2)
  %{"CRDT" => "is magic!"}
  ```

  Start a DeltaCrdt and link it to the calling process.

  There are a number of options you can specify to tweak the behaviour of DeltaCrdt:
  - `:notify` - when the state of the CRDT has changed, `msg` will be sent to `pid`. Varying `msg` allows a single process to listen for updates from multiple CRDTs.
  - `:sync_interval` - the delta CRDT will attempt to sync its local changes with its neighbours at this interval. Default is 50.
  - `:ship_interval` - the delta CRDT will notify the listener at this interval, in ms. Default is 50.
  - `:ship_debounce` - debounce notify messages, in milliseconds. Default is 50.

  Mutate the CRDT synchronously.

  For the asynchronous version of this function, see `mutate_async/3`.

  To see which operations are available, see the documentation for the crdt module that was provided in `start_link/3`.

  For example, `DeltaCrdt.AWLWWMap` has a function `add` that takes 4 arguments. The last 2 arguments are supplied by DeltaCrdt internally, so you have to provide only the first two arguments: `key` and `val`. That would look like this: `DeltaCrdt.mutate(crdt, :add, ["CRDT", "is magic!"])`. This pattern is repeated for all mutation functions. Another exaple: to call `DeltaCrdt.AWLWWMap.clear`, use `DeltaCrdt.mutate(crdt, :clear, [])`.
